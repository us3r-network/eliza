Managed to login to twitter finally by spoofing the browser for VPS
For anyone that is having trouble this is way easier than setting up graphic interface or VPN

used Firefox settings > Network settings > manual proxy config

Set SOCKS Host to 127.0.0.1 on port 8080
ssh -D 127.0.0.1:8080 user@<vps ip address>.
#this using Mac/Windows you may need to generate keys

Then use firefox browser to login and complete verification
this shit works!
make sure you do the fire fox stuff on your current pc but do the SSH into your vps, then grab the cookies from the modified settings fire fox browsers cookies using like "Edit cookie" extension and put that into the .env of your server
